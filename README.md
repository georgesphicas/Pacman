# Pacman
Fully built custom version of Pac-Man, including threaded character animations, object-oriented design, 
custom soundtracks, and original character/object sprites. Spent 15-20 hours a week over the course of 3 weeks developing my own 
version of Pacman for a final project for my CS course. Heavily studied 2D game design theory in Java, and learned
how to utilize JFrames, JPanels, utilize reusable classes and inheritance to create block, player, and enemy objects,
and got extensive practice using Object-Oriented Design.
